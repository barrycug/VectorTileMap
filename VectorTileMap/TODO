- refactor projection functions which are currently spread all over the place

- rewrite TouchHandler, implement gesture recognition for rotation/tilt/scaling

- cache: 
	- collect tiles from 4 zoomlevels into one cache-tile (GEM-File?)

- labeling
  - use relevance tag, sort labels by relevance for faster dynamic placement 
  - throw out overlapping labels with less relevance!
	- use separate datasource?
  	this would allow for reuse in multiple zoomlevels and 
  	reducing the problem of tile clipped ways
  - text renderer for paths
  - interface for different placement algorithms
  - support icon+text items
  
- zoom to bounding box animator

- gl-compositing of overlay item bubble
